# neural-network-challenge-1
# Description
This program looks at a dataset that is being used to predict if a student will repay their student loan.  Target and feature datasets are identified and standscaler is used to preprocess the data.  A sequential neural network model is then built and evaluated.  74% accuracy was achieved before hypertuning and 77% accuracy was achieved after hypertuning.
